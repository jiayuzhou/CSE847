Time: Monday and Wednesday 10:20am - 11:40am

Location: Engineering Building, **EB 3400**  

Office Hours: Monday and Wednesday 11:40am-12:30pm, EB 2134


## Course Description
Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., that learn to spot high-risk medical patients, recognize speech, classify text documents, detect credit card fraud, or drive autonomous robots). This course provides an in-depth understanding of machine learning and statistical pattern recognition techniques and their applications in biomedical informatics, computer vision, and other domains.

Topics: probability distributions, regression, classification, kernel methods, clustering, semi-supervised learning, mixture models, graphical models, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, sparse learning, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and Hidden Markov Models.

Homework assignments include both theoretic derivation and hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. Every student is required to finish a project that is either assigned by the intructor or designed by the student himself.

## Course Announcements
Announcements will be emailed to the course mailing list. A welcome note will be sent to the mailing list at the beginning of the semester.  If you do not receive the welcome message before the first class, please [send mail to me](mailto:jiayuz@msu.edu).

## Policies
### Course Requirements and Grading
The grade will be calculated as follows:

* Assignments: 40%
* Project: 25% 
* Exam: 30% 
* Class participation: 5% 

### Homework
*Lateness and Extensions*

Homework is worth full credit at the beginning of class on the due date (later if an extension has been granted). It is worth at most 90% credit for the next 24 hours. It is worth at most 50% credit for the following 24 hours. It is worth 25% credit after that.  If you need an extension, please ask for it (by sending email to the instructor) as soon as the need for it is known.  Extensions that are requested promptly will be granted more liberally.  You must turn in all assignments.

*Collaboration among Students*

The purpose of student collaboration is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent it. Studying the material in groups is strongly encouraged. It is also allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular homework problem, provided no written notes are shared, or are taken at that time, and provided learning is facilitated, not circumvented. The actual solution must be done by each student alone, and the student should be ready to reproduce their solution upon request. Any form of help or collaboration must be disclosed in full by all involved on the first page of their assignment. In any case, you must exercise academic integrity.

### Class Participation
Students are required to attend all classes and actively participate in discussions.

## Other Policies
### Spartan Code of Honor
Student leaders have recognized the challenging task of discouraging plagiarism from the academic community. The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is proud to be launching the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, focused on valuing academic integrity and honest work ethics at Michigan State University. The pledge reads as follows:

> As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do. 

The Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge embodies the principles of integrity that every Spartan is required to uphold in their time as a student, and beyond. The academic pledge was crafted with inspiration of existing individual college honor codes, establishing an overarching statement for the entire university. It was formally adopted by ASMSU on March 3, 2016, endorsed by Academic Governance on March 22, 2016, and recognized by the Provost, President, and Board of Trustees on April 15, 2016. Student conduct that is inconsistent with the academic pledge is addressed through existing policies, regulations, and ordinances governing academic honesty and integrity: Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, Student Rights and Responsibilities, and General Student Regulations.

### Academic Honesty
Article 2.3.3 of the Academic Freedom Report states that The student shares with the faculty the responsibility
for maintaining the integrity of scholarship, grades, and professional standards. In addition, the (insert name of
unit offering course) adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations
1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades; the all University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades; and
Ordinance 17.00, Examinations. (See Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide and/or the MSU Web
site: www.msu.edu.) Therefore, unless authorized by your instructor, you are expected to complete all course
assignments, including homework, lab work, quizzes, tests and exams, without assistance from any source. You are
expected to develop original work for this course; therefore, you may not submit course work you completed for
another course to satisfy the requirements for this course. Also, you are not authorized to use the www.allmsu.com
Web site to complete any course work in this course. Students who violate MSU academic integrity rules may
receive a penalty grade, including a failing grade on the assignment or in the course. Contact your instructor if you
are unsure about the appropriateness of your course work. (See also the Academic Integrity webpage.)

### Limits to confidentiality
Essays, journals, and other materials submitted for this class are generally considered confidential pursuant to
the Universitys student record policies. However, students should be aware that University employees, including
instructors, may not be able to maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain
issues to protect the health and safety of MSU community members and others. As the instructor, I must report
the following information to the Department of Police and Public Safety if you share it with me: Suspected child
abuse/neglect, even if this maltreatment happened when you were a child, Allegations of sexual assault or sexual
harassment when they involve MSU students, faculty, or staff, and Credible threats of harm to oneself or to others.
These reports will trigger contact from the Department of Police and Public Safety who will want to talk with you
about the incident that you have shared. In almost all cases, it will be your decision whether you wish to speak
with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting you are encouraged
to make an appointment with the MSU Counseling Center.
